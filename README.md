# Helping-Hands
Helping Hands (Disaster Safety Application) is developed to help people during disaster. People face critical problems due to sudden and unexpected occurrence of disaster which leads to loss of life and property. This problem is faced every year, so our solution acts as an effective tool providing right information and services at the right time to the person in need at the critical time of disaster. We present an approach which comes effective for giving forecasting of expected disaster in advance, helps in evacuating masses to safe locations providing safe routes and providing a common platform for volunteers to reach out to the affected people, organizing people in shelter and their basic needs. The Disaster Safety Application (DSA) is an innovative and comprehensive solution designed to address the challenges faced by individuals, communities, and organizations in mitigating and responding to catastrophic events. With the increasing frequency and intensity of disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and landslides, there is a critical need for a centralized platform that empowers users to enhance their preparedness, coordination, and recovery efforts.
